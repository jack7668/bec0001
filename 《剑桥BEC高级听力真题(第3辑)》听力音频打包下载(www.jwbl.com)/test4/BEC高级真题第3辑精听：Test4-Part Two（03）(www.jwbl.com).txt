Woman: When I worked in import-export, the best thing I ever did was getting myself transferred from one section to another. It happened because I'd calculated how much we should charge a customer for some goods we were going to import on a regular basis, and didn't allow for our agent's commission. When the invoices started coming in, I realized we were making a loss. I tried to increase the price to the customer without telling my boss, but, in the end, I had to admit what I'd done, and I think that's the only reason I didn't get the sack. It gave us quite serious cash flow problems for a few months. But it made me realize that I really wasn't interested in that side of the work.

女子：我曾经在进出口行业工作，而我做的最正确的事就是把我自己从一个部门换到了另一个部门。当时，我们要定期出口给某位客户的货物的报价我本来已经算过了，但是没有考虑我们的代理的回扣。当单据逐渐到位之后，我意识到我们亏了。我便想在老板不知情的情况下让客户加价，但最后我还是得承认加价的事，我想我没被辞退就是因为我承认了。这件事情导致我们接下来的几个月都面临着严重的资金周转问题。但这件事让我意识到我对那方面的工作其实并不感兴趣。
