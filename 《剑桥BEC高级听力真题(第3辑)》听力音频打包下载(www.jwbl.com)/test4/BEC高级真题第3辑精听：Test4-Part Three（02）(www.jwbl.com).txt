标题：BEC高级真题第3辑精听：Test4-Part Three（02）

听力内容：

Woman: So, I guess it's quite surprising, in a way, that it was the leadership group which authored them… what's good, I think, is the way they've spent quite an amount of time consulting with management at all levels, so they have a kind of hands-on feel.

女：所以，真正关键的还是把关的领导们，这一点在某种程度上还是挺令人惊讶的。不过，好在他们花了很多时间与各级管理层进行磋商，所以他们的心里还是有数的。

Man:So what will affect us first?

男；那最先会影响到我们的是哪个方面呢？

Woman: Well, the skills audit, though its real effects won't be apparent for some time. I don't know, I think that was a wasted opportunity, really… It was so thorough, too thorough in fact… I mean, they asked absolutely everyone about absolutely everything because they were so obsessed with wanting to be accurate, but the result is they're just swamped with information… they didn't need to be that in-depth…

女：嗯，应该是技能审核，虽然这方面的影响一时半会儿并不会很明显。不过我也拿不准。我觉得这个机会浪费了，他们做得非常到位。甚至可以说是过于到位了，因为他们执意要做到精确无误，所以凡事都要过问每一个人，所以结果他们只是拿到了一大堆他们并不需要那么细致的信息。

Man:Uh-huh… So is it really these divisional targets that will have the first impact?

男：可不是……那真正先起作用的是这些分割的目标吗？

Woman: Er, yeah, I suppose… but then again, there's some poor design involved there… Oh sure, they've carefully calculated how sales move throughout the year, but the point is that it's not only shifting actual products that counts – the targets should really be looking at data on customer satisfaction too, which is certainly a major concern in my section, where we're always looking for ways to keep that high enough to retain customers.

女：这个嘛，应该是的，不过，这方面的设计也还是有很糟糕的地方，他们已经仔细计算过全年销售额的变化情况，但关键在于重要的不仅仅是要更换实际产品，还应该关注关注客户满意度方面的数据，后者无疑是我们部门的一个重大关切，因为我们一直在想办法维持良好的客户满意度，以便留住客户。

Man:So, are you unconvinced about the suggestions scheme too?

男：那么，你也不看好这个建议奖励计划吗？

Woman: Er… I just think they should have gone further with it.

女：这个嘛……我只是觉得他们的计划应该更进一步。
