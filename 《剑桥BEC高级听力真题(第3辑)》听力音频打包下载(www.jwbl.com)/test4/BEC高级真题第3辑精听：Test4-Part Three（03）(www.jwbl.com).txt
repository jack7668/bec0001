标题：BEC高级真题第3辑精听：Test4-Part Three（03）

听力内容：

Woman: After all the publicity it's been given, you'd think they'd want to involve everyone… what you don't want is just the same ideas from the same people all the time… we've got all these short-term workers, they're in and out of organisations all the time… we should be trying to capture their insights and observations, especially since they won't personally stand to benefit from making suggestions.

女：经过所有的宣传之后，你会觉得他们是想要让每个人都参与进来。你不希望看到的只不过是一直由那群人出一些千年不变的主意，我们有那么多的临时员工，他们会频繁地换工作，我们应该了解了解他们的见解和观察，何况他们个人还不指望靠建议谋利。

Man:And do you think the performance reviews are similarly flawed in their approach?

男：那您觉得绩效评估同样存在缺陷吗？

Woman: Oh, I don't want to seem too negative! The only unfortunate thing there is not incorporating what competitors are doing. We don't want to be say one of our reps is underperforming at the moment, only to find out that so is everyone in the business at the moment. That could be very unfair, especially on the reps abroad, who are at the mercy of the supply situation too.

女：啊，我可不想表现得太消极噢！绩效评估方面唯一遗憾的是没有体现我们的竞争对手正在做的事情。我们不希望说我们的某位代表目前表现不佳，结果却发现业内每个人都是如此。那样就会非常不公平，特别是对国外的代表来说，因为他们还受到了供应形势的影响。

Man:And do you think that people have been missed out of the training programmes as well?

男：那您觉得大家是不是也错过了培训计划？

Woman: No, there I'm quite positive! They're going to be a real winner, I'm sure. A long time's been spent on trying to get our training right, and I think the final results are great. We've been far too focused on IT training, and it's much better now that it's broadening out to include more aspects for staff to select from, according to their needs.

女：不，这个答案我还是非常肯定的！我敢肯定，他们一定会成为真正的赢家的。我们花了很长一段时间来纠正我们的培训内容，最终的结果还是很棒的。我们一直以来都过于专注于IT培训了，现在要好多了，因为我们已经拓展了培训的内容，员工有了更多的选择空间，能够根据自己的需要来选择培训课程。

Man:So would you see all the changes having a lasting impact?

男：那您觉得所有这些变化会产生深远的影响吗？

Woman: Well, they must have some kind of future… after all, they're the kind of thing our competitors have been doing for some time. But, well, by the end of the year, I'm fairly sure they'll get scrutinized, thoroughly checked and probably revised before they become fixed as company policy in the long term.

女：这个嘛，它们产生的影响肯定是会持续一段时间的。毕竟，这些事情我们的竞争对手已经做了一段时间了。但是，我相信，到今年年底，这些变化在被确定下来写入公司的长期政策之前，肯定会经过仔细、彻底的检查甚至是修订。

Man:So it's a case of wait and see?

男：所以又要拭目以待了是吗？

Woman: Definitely. Now…

女：肯定要。
