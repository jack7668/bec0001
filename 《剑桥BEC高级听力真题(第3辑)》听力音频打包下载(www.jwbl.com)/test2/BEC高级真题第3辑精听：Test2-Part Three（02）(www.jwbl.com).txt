标题：BEC高级真题第3辑精听：Test2-Part Three（02）

听力内容：

Man: Before it was started, the greatest fear was that, with the change in the support provided, people would be less productive. As it's turned out, staff have to be actively encouraged to take short breaks. You see, they tend to feel they have to answer the phone at the first ring, in case their manager thinks they're sitting around watching TV, even though they know we don't do that kind of checking up.

男：在实行这种制度之前，人们最大的担忧是，随着公司提供的设备的变化，员工的工作效率会降低。事实证明，我们必须积极鼓励员工在工作时做短暂的休息。因为，他们普遍认为只要电话铃一响，他们就应该立马接起来，以免被经理认为他们是在看电视而不是在工作，尽管他们知道我们并不会去查他们的岗。

Woman: When you joined Carserve you weren't happy with the ways things were being run, were you? What was the problem?

女：当初加入Carserve的时候，你对公司的运作并不满意，是吗？那公司当时的问题是出在哪里的呢？

Man: The management focused on what could be put down on paper, like an organogram showing reporting lines. But they tended to avoid the less concrete issues, like how to ensure the workers knew what they were expected to achieve. So despite detailed planning and plenty of memos, in reality people were working in a bit of a vacuum.

男：当时的管理层看重的都是能留在纸上的东西，比如显示汇报关系的组织图，但他们倾向于避开不那么具体的问题，比如如何确保员工知道他们应该达到的目标。所以，即便有详细的计划和大量的备忘录，员工们实际上还是在真空环境里工作。

Woman: How did you turn that around?

女：那你是怎么扭转局势的呢？
