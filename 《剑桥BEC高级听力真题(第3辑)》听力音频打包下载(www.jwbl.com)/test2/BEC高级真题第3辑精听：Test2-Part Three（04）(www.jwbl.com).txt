标题：BEC高级真题第3辑精听：Test2-Part Three（04）

听力内容：

Man: Not entirely. In fact, managers often work from home too, and staff are sometimes afraid, wrongly in fact, that a phone call will disturb them, or that an email won't be read on time. So, we make sure staff can regularly talk to their managers face-to-face.

男：没有。事实上，经理们也经常在家工作，但工作人员有时会害怕，实际上是他们想错了，打电话给经理会打扰到他们，害怕他们没有及时看到邮件。所以，我们也确保了员工可以定期与他们的经理面对面地沟通。

Woman: Doesn't remote working make it difficult for managers to carry out their work?

女：远程工作不会让管理人员难以开展他们的工作吗？

Man: It certainly changes its nature. As part of our performance management process, managers visit staff at home twice a month. When everyone works in one office, you get on with some, and have less rapport with others, and usually that doesn't matter. But when you travel around visiting staff in their own homes, you have to develop relationships with them that are based on their needs, which may mean helping them with aspects of their non-working lives that are affecting their work.

男：远程工作确实改变了管理工作的本质。我们的绩效管理流程也规定了，经理们每个月都要去员工家探访两次。坐办公室的时候，大家都会和一部分同事很好，和其他人的关系就不那么亲近，这通常来说都是没问题的。但是当你四处探访员工的家时，你就必须根据他们的需要和他们相处，这也可许就意味着要帮助他们解决工作之外但会影响到他们工作的问题。

Woman: So, have you organised training for managers, to deal with this new way of working?

女：那你们有没有给经理们组织培训课来适应这种新型工作方式呢？

Man: Yes, a great deal of thought goes into finding out what would most benefit staff. Many people would focus on how to use the technology, but in our experience that isn't a priority. We've already run workshops on managing remote teams, but many managers find it hard to let go of their traditional control, and feel that remote working is a recipe for chaos. We're trying to tackle this.

男：有，我们针对怎么样才能让员工的福利最大化想了很多。很多人都会把注意力集中在技术的应用上，但根据我们的经验，技术在我们这里并不是最重要的。我们开设了管理远程团队的研讨会，但很多管理人员都发现很难放弃他们传统的管理方法，觉得远程工作就是管理混乱的原因。我们正在想办法解决这个问题。

Woman: Steve Marriott, thank you very much.

女；非常感谢史蒂夫·马里奥特来参加我们的节目。

Man: Thank you.

男；谢谢您。
