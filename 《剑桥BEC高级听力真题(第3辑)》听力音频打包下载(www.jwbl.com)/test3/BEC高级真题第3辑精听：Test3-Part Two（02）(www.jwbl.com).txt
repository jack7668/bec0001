Speaker Two

二号发言人。

Man: The Chief Executive was there, and all the senior managers and department heads, and the idea was that we'd plan how to introduce the new structure that's going to be put in place next year. First, the CE presented the company's objectives and the new organisation, then we broke up into small groups to discuss how to implement it all. After that, each group gave their comments to the whole seminar. Some very sensible criticisms were made, which the boss clearly wasn't expecting, but he did agree not to split up the marketing department after all. Anyway, we ended up by agreeing on a timetable for a meeting to brief the workforce and for the various moves, so we're probably quite well prepared now.

男子：董事长也出席了研讨会，还有公司所有高管和部门主管，会议旨在讨论如何引入原计划明年落实的新机构。董事长先介绍了公司的目标和新机构，然后我们分成小组讨论如何来落实。接着，每个小组都对整个研讨会发表了意见。大家也做了一些非常睿智的批评，老板显然没有预料到这一点，但他还是同意了不拆分营销部门。总之，我们最终就制定时间表，召开会议通知工作人员以及诸多举措达成了一致，所以可以说我们现在已经做好充分准备了。
