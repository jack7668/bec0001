标题：BEC高级真题第3辑精听：Test3-Part Three（01）

听力内容：

Woman: OK... now, next we'd better discuss the recruitment plan for staff at the new factory in Dinsdale. I don't think we'll have any problems, do you?

女子：好的......那接下来我们说说丁斯代尔新厂的招聘计划吧。应该不会出什么问题吧？

Man: No, not really. I mean, it's in a pretty good location for accessing a large workforce so we should have our pick. Anyway, I would have thought that our new policy of letting staff choose when they work within a certain time frame will appeal to lots of people.

男子：应该不会。那个厂的选址很好，附近的人力资源很充足，所以我们的选择空间还是挺大的。不管怎么说，我还是觉得让员工自己选工作时间的这个新政策是非常吸引人的。

Woman: Yes, I think we may miss out on the high- fliers who are looking to get up the ladder quickly, but it's more important to get a core of stable staff.

女子：没错，我们可能会错过那些野心勃勃，想要快速晋升的人，但是，更重要的还是保证主要的员工能够稳定下来不是嘛。

Man: When did you want to start advertising? Has the Board agreed on numbers yet?

男子；你打算什么时候开始放广告？董事会就广告的数额达成一致了吗？

Woman: Oh yes, that was decided before that last meeting when the top brass met - that's why they're pressing us to do something. I don't want to initiate it just yet, but we do need to do it in advance of the holiday period.

女子：啊，达成一致了，高管们上次会面的那次会议之前就已经通过了，所以他们才会催我们赶紧落实。现在我还不想放，但我们确实需要在假期之前安排好。

Man: Well, OK. But I don't think there's any point in going ahead until the factory is nearly completed, is there? That way, we'd have plenty of time for planning.

男子：也行。但我觉得根本没有必要在工厂完工之前开始投放，你觉得呢？

不然我们还有充足的时间来安排。

Woman: Hmm... that's a good point. Well, let's aim for that then. I'll try and get a date out of the Director. Right, now Mr Dawson asked me what we thought about appointing somebody to oversee all this because we're both going to be tied up here. I suggested to him that they send someone down from Head Office but he didn't seem very keen.

女子：嗯......有道理。那我们就朝这个思路来吧。我会试着约一下董事的。还有就是，道森问我是否考虑派个人过去监督所有的工作，因为我们两个都走不开。我建议他从总部派人过去，但他对此似乎热情不高。

Man: I don't think that's a good idea because they won't know the local situation. We'd be better off putting it in the hands of a recruitment agency - they could do all the initial filtering. The manager at the new factory wants to be involved but he can step in to help later on, which means we'd have some internal control.

男子：嗯……我觉得不太妥，因为总部的人对当地的情况并不是很了解。我们最好把确定这个人选的工作交给招聘机构，他们可以帮我们进行初步的筛选。虽然新厂的经理希望能够出点力，但我们可以让他后面再接手，这样我们内部也能掌握更多的主动权。
