标题：BEC高级真题第3辑精听：Test3-Part One（03）

听力内容：

Just looking round the newsagents this week, you'll find one magazine giving away a book worth six ninety-nine, when the magazine itself only costs two ninety-nine. And it doesn't stop there. One rival is offering a CD, another a calculator. And so it goes on. You know, it really is a ‘readers' market at the moment.

不信你只要这周去报刊亭转转，就会发现一本杂志附赠一本书时价格为6.99美元，而杂志本身的售价才2.99美元。还不止于此。我们的一个竞争对手附赠了CD，另一个附赠的是计算器。不一而足。你们知道的，如今的杂志市场已经成了“读者”市场了。

But, I can see you're asking yourselves, if the gifts are actually far more expensive than the magazines... ? Well, clearly, the magazines are facing greater competition and it's all about offering your reader the best possible value. If your competitor's got something out, then you don't want to be seen to be lagging behind. And once you've started, in a sense, you've got to keep on - you do get locked into a ‘circulation war' where the only way to stay on top seems to be through the free gifts. And remember, it doesn't matter if the gift costs more than the magazine because the real profits come not from the cover price, but from the advertising revenues. To keep those flowing in, you need good figures, and that's where the free gifts come in.

我知道你们想问，礼物的价格是不是比杂志还贵得多？显然，杂志面临的竞争更激烈，而一切都是为了给读者提供最多的价值。如果你的竞争对手送了赠品，那你也不希望别人觉得你落了后。一旦你走上送赠品这条路，从某种程度上来说，你就没了回头路。你就会陷入一场无限循环的战争，而保持领先地位的唯一办法就是送赠品。还有，记住了，礼物的价格是否高于杂志并不重要，因为真正的利润并不来自于杂志封面上标的价格，而是来自广告收入。要想有源源不断的广告收入，你得有好的销量，而销量就要靠免费礼物来打开。

And, of course, it can't be any old gift. An inappropriate choice would do more harm than good. The gift must reinforce the true brand values of the magazine. The specialist titles are particularly good at this. And it's also a good opportunity for people to sample your magazine; it may bring in new readers. With the right gift, you could even be looking at as much as fifteen per cent uplift on your sales, particularly in the teen market, where pop fashions come and go and it's very important to encourage reader loyalty.

当然了，赠品也不是随随便便送的老一套赠品。不恰当的选择只会弊大于利。礼物必须要能强化杂志真正的品牌价值。使用专门的标题效果会格外好。而且，这也是一个很好的让人们尝试购买的机会，或许还能帮你收获新读者。礼物选对了，销售额上涨15％都是有可能的，特别是针对青少年市场的杂志，因为那个市场的风尚很容易改变，所以，培养读者的忠诚度非常重要。
