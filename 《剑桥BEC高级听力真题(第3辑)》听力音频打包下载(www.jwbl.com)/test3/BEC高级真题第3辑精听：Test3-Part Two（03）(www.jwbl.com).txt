Speaker Three

三号发言人。

Woman:I went to something called a 'team role laboratory', which was for the manager, supervisors and all the staff of my department. The idea was to focus on everyone's behaviour and working relationships. It was a very powerful experience, as you can imagine, because it brought up all sorts of feelings. There's a lot of resentment at some people never being around when there's an emergency, and at the way one of the supervisors lets people get away with anything. In fact, this made him realise he's not cut out for the job, and he's since resigned. We also tried to establish what the department's objectives were, and it was an eye-opener to some people to discover what we're actually supposed to be doing, and how we fit in with the rest of the company.

女子：我参加一个所谓的“团队角色实验室”的研讨会，是专门针对经理、主管以及我部门所有员工的一个研讨会。研讨会的宗旨是聚焦每个人的行为和工作关系。可想而知，本次研讨会是一次非常震撼的体验，因为它带给大家的感受是复杂的。因为有些人一遇到紧急情况就开溜，而某个主管总是让某些人钻空子，大家对他们的憎恶也是可想而知的。事实上，这次经历让那位主管意识到了他不适合那份工作，所以之后便辞职了。此外，我们也试图朝着部门的目标努力。最后，对部分人来说，这次体验也让他们大开了眼界，让他们意识到了我们原本的工作职责，以及应该如何融入到公司其他人中间。
