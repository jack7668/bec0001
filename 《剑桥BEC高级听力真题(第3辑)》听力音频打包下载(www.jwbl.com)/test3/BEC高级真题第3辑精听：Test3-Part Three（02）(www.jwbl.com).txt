标题：BEC高级真题第3辑精听：Test3-Part Three（02）

听力内容：

Woman: Yes, that's a good idea. I'll suggest that. I also had a discussion with Mr Dawson about what kind of experience we would be looking for in new staff. I was quite surprised actually because he said he didn't think we need people to have done exactly the same thing as long as they had about four or five years' general work experience. But I pointed out to him that if we just take anybody from any field then we're bound to end up with a lot of wastage because a lot of them will turn out not to be suitable. So I proposed that we appoint people who've worked in something similar. As long as they've got a rough idea of what the job involves, that's the main thing.

女子：嗯，好主意。我会跟道森反映的。我们还谈到了应该招聘什么样的新人。我还挺吃惊的，因为他说他觉得只要求职者有四到五年的工作经验就行，不一定非要是从事这个行业的。不过我也说了，如果我们随便哪个行业的人都招，那我们必然会白费很多功夫，因为招来的人最后肯定有很多是不合适的。所以我建议我们聘用有过类似工作经验的。他们要对工作涉及的内容有一个大概的了解，这才是最主要的。

Man: Yes, I agree. Will the new staff get the same deal as everybody here?

男子：嗯，我也觉得。新员工和现在的员工待遇一样吗？

Woman: What d'you mean?

女子：什么意思？

Man: Well, the canteen and everything?

男子：就是有没有工作餐之类的？

Woman: Let me have a look.., yes, more or less. There's the travel allowance, but we are going to look at that over the next couple of years to see if we are going to retain it or not. It's one of the possible cost savings. Also, although we're building a canteen there, we're getting outside caterers in - it'll be much cheaper than the system we've got here. The staff will have to pay slightly more because the company won't be making a contribution but it won't be much more.

女子：我看看，有，多多少少都会有的。还有出差补贴，但这项福利到底要不要保留，接下来的几年我们还要再考虑一下。因为压缩成本或许也可以从这方面下手。还有就是，虽然那边我们也会修食堂，但我们也会对外开放，价格会比我们这边的便宜。员工在那边用餐会稍微贵一点，因为公司没有补贴，但不会贵很多。
