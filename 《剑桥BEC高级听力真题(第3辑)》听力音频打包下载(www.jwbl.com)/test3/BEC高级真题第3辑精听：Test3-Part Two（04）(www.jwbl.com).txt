Speaker Four

四号发言人

Man:They'd invited the managers of a different-sized store in each division, together with some of the higher-level managers, and we were grouped in vertical lines. So, I was with my area manager and her division manager. We had to brainstorm how to cut costs and improve margins in the light of last year's poor figures. At first, I was afraid of disagreeing with my boss in case it was held against me in the future, but, after a while, we felt more like equals. It made me realise how little I'm told about the big issues in the company: some of my suggestions couldn't be implemented for reasons I didn't know anything about. So, one good thing that came out of it was that my boss agreed to meet me and the other store managers once a month to tell us what's going on in the company.

男子：我们的研讨会邀请了每个部门不同等级的经理经理，还有一些高层，然后按垂直关系分了小组。我和我的区域经理以及她的部门经理分到了一组。我们要想出在去年成绩不佳的情况下降本增效的办法。一开始，我不敢对老板的意见有异议，以免日后落下把柄，但过了一段时间之后，我们感觉更平等了。这次经历也让我意识到之前我对公司的大事知之甚少：我提出的建议有些不能实行，至于原因我丝毫不知。不过好在经过这次研讨会，老板同意每个月约见我和其他店铺经理，告知公司的近况。
