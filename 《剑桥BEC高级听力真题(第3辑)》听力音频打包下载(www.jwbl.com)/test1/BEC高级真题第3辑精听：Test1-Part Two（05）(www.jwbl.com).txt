Speaker Five 

五号发言人

Woman: I sometimes really do think that the people who know least about a company are the people who run it... that's why there's such an industry in advising on and supplying the skills for managing change. We went along assuming that we were selling well because of what we saw as our core qualities but we were wrong. 

女：有时候，我真的觉得那些管理公司的反而是对公司了解最少的人......这就是之所以会存在为公司管理变动提供建议和技能的行业的原因。一直以来，我们都以为我们的销量会很可观，因为我们有我们的核心品质，但我们错了。

It was just that we happened to have got our pricing right, so when we changed that, it all started falling apart. Things got decidedly grim for a time, and drastic action was required. A merger was considered, and an aggressive takeover had to be fought off. 

我们只是碰巧定价定对了，所以一改变定价，问题就来了。问题一度变得非常严峻，采取极端行动迫在眉睫。我们考虑过合并，而且必须采取激进的收购措施。

In the end, it was easier to accept an offer for the Budget Products Division, and avoid major redundancies, than to go on trying to keep the whole thing afloat.

最后，相比费尽心思维持整个公司的运转，预算产品部门还是觉得接受报价，避免大规模裁员更容易接受。
