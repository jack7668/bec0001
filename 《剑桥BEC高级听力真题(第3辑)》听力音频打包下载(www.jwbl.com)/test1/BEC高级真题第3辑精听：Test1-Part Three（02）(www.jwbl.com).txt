标题：BEC高级真题第3辑精听：Test1-Part Three（02）

听力内容：

Woman: Right, and that suggests the qualities that are most germane to the job. Ultimately, I suppose, we're looking for a level of adaptability that it's fair to say someone in his position may not have had the chance to really demonstrate yet.., but his familiarity with the goods we produce is second-to-none, so I think the signs are there that he may become an astute analyst and problem-solver.

女：没错，那件事恰好说明了他具备这份工作最需要的素质。说到底，我想，我们要考察的是适应能力的好坏，但可以说，他那个职位的人可能都还没有机会证明这一能力。不过，他对我们生产的产品的了解可以说是首屈一指的，所以，我觉得，诸多迹象都表明，他是可能成为一名精明的分析师和解决问题的行家的。

Man: That's certainly encouraging. And it's not just in the office that he's been looking good. I sent him abroad as part of that group a few weeks ago. The basic brief was to secure a continuation of the Asian contract. To be honest, that was a bit of a given, and what I was really hoping for was something extra. And sure enough, he clearly really worked on all our contacts out there, and he came back with some great new insights into how we might be able to develop bulk sales direcdy through warehouses, rather than through the standard agency channels.

男：的确是令人很欣慰。而且，他不仅仅在办公室里表现得好。几周前，我也派了他和大家一起去海外出差。此行最主要的目的还是去拿下我们和亚洲那边续签的合同。老实说，能不能拿下其实还不一定，但我真正期望的并不是这个。最后，他真的联系了我们那边的所有联系人，并带回来了一些非常地道的见解，说我们可以如何通过仓库而非标准的中介代理进行批发销售。

Woman: Oh right, interesting I missed the de- brief on that one. But I do know he went on a training course not so long ago, and clearly reaped the benefits there. The content was mundane enough -‘how to produce effective reports' or somesuch but he identified the points that really mattered, and saw that what it actually addressed was how to order the most pertinent facts for delivery to a team.

女：嗯，有意思，述职的时候这个我倒没听到。但我的确知道他不久前参加过一个培训课程，显然，他学到了不少东西。课程的内容普通得很——就是“如何做好报告”之类的课——但他还是抓住了课程的重点，认识到了课程实际上讲的是如何在演讲时讲关联性最强的事实呈现给一个团队。

Man: So, it's good news all round?

男：所以，总而言之还是好消息对吧。
