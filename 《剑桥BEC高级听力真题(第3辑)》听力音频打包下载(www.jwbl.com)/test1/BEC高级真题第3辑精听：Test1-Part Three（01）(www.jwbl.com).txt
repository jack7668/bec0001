标题：BEC高级真题第3辑精听：Test1-Part Three（01）

听力内容：

Man: Well, Deborah, we need to think about the candidates who've put in applications for the post of area manager.

男：对了，黛博拉，我们得挑一挑那些应聘我们的地区经理的人了。

Woman: Yes, John, it's an exciting new role, and it fits in with the strategy development plan.

女：是的，约翰，这个岗位还挺令人期待的呢，是配合我们的战略发展计划的一个岗位对吧。

Man: Quite. It's part of a logical progression in our approach to management, carefully consolidating our skills base. It should mean a new chain of command, but based on tried and tested methods.., we'll be stronger as a result.

男：可不是嘛。是我们的管理理念，精心巩固我们的技能基础，下自然而然的结果。为的就是发展新的管理团队，但还是要依托反复经过实践的验证这一点，我们就总有强大的一天。

Woman: Well that's the idea. Now, the first one that's come in is from Colin...

女：嗯，就是这个意思。第一份简历是科林的……

Man: The assistant manager for the south-east?

男：东南地区的那个副经理？

Woman: Yes. Colin's clearly keen...

女：是的。科林显然很想得到这个职位……

Man: But of course, it's an attractive proposition.

男：不过话说回来了，这本来就是一个炙手可热的岗位。

Woman: And I think that's what's drawn him. He's said his current post is demanding as well he might but that he's keen to position himself in the spotlight here. Reading between the lines, I think the alternative, as he sees it, is to move sideways to IT, which is where his background is. It would be a shame to lose someone like him ... he's hungry.

女：我想他就是为了这个才应聘的。他说，他现在的职位要求也很高，但他还是很想来这边发展。看他这意思，我觉得吧，他是觉得调到IT也可以，毕竟IT才是他的老本行。失去他这样的人才会很可惜……他意愿很强。

Man: Yes, it's a genuine application. He's a serious contender. I was struck recently... I think it was last month.., by his problem- solving abilities. He was passed a complaint it wasn't really his problem at all but he took it up anyway, about some faulty goods we'd supplied, apparently. I think he saw it as an efficiency issue, and so relevant to any responsible person here. And he reacted really well, so that the customer went away happy after all.

男：他的简历写得很诚恳。看来是一个有力的竞争者啊。最近，准确来说是上个月，他解决问题的能力给我留下了深刻的印象。当时他收到了投诉，原本并不是他的问题，但他还是立马行动了起来，显然，问题是我们卖出去的产品中有一些次品。而他应该是觉得次品问题也是效率问题，所以跟公司每一位有责任心的人都有关。最后他把问题处理得很好，给了客户一个满意的答复。
