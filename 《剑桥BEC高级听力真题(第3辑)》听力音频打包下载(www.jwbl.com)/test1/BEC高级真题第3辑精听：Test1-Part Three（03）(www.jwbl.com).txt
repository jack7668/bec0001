标题：BEC高级真题第3辑精听：Test1-Part Three（03）

听力内容：

Woman: Let's look at what his reference has to say. He does have shortcomings, of course. His confidence is very strong, almost to a fault, you might say, which could lead to difficulties on the patience front.., just because he gets the point quickly doesn't mean he's entitled to think everyone else does, that they share the same conclusions.., others may be behind in terms of objectivity, still grappling with issues that impact personally on themselves.

女：嗯，我们看看他的推荐信怎么说的吧。他的确也有缺点，这个自然。他非常自信，也可以说是有些自信过头了，为此耐心方面可能会存在一些问题。他脑筋转得快并不代表他就有权利觉得别人也能转得很快，觉得大家和他的看法一样，在客观性上，其他人可能会不及他，因为他们可能还在忙着解决影响他们个人的问题。

Man: Hmm, that'd certainly be something to watch, I guess. Still, we're not looking for perfection, are we? And we're not going to be setting up a lone operator.

男：嗯……这一点确实还需要观察观察。不过话说回来，我们也没有打算找到一个完人的对吧？我们也没有打算找一个孤军奋战的人嘛。

Woman: Oh, far from it. Whoever gets the job will be well backed up. I was talking to the consultants the other day, and they were quite critical of our reliance on checking performance through the one-to-one appraisal system, so it's been decided that this new post will be linked into the cross-departmental advisory group that was set up a few months ago, and benefit from dealing with them and getting their input. That should help quite a bit.

女：嗯，那是自然。无论最终选谁来担任这个职位，他都需要有很好的人缘。我那天跟顾问们聊了聊，他们对我们用一对一的考核体系考察员工的业绩颇有微词，所以，最后我们决定把这个新岗位纳入几个月前成立的部门交叉咨询团队里，希望能从和其他部门的人打交道，从他们的输入中收益吧。应该会受益良多的。

Man: That makes a lot sense. Well, let's talk about some of the other candidates...

男：非常有道理。嗯，那我们接下来看看其他的候选人吧……
