标题：BEC高级真题第2辑精听：Test3-Part Three（01）

听力内容：

Woman：Whew, what a meeting! Were you as surprised as I was, Jerry?

女：哇，难以想象的会议！你和我一样感到吃惊吗，杰里？

Man：You bet. When the Chairman called us to it, I thought it might be about the takeover that there have been rumours about,

男：当然。当主席叫我们去参加的时候，我想可能是关于收购的传言，

but I didn't expect anything like the Chief Executive being forced out.

但是我没有料到首席执行官会被迫离职。

Woman: No. It doesn't seem fair to blame him for the American project not making much money, when it hasn't had long to establish itself.

女：没想到。在美洲项目没有站稳脚跟的时候，把此项目没赚多少钱的事情怪到他身上，这似乎并不公平。

And I can’t see why the Board have decided to end it now.

而且我不懂为什么董事会现在把这个项目停了。

After all, they didn't seem worried earlier this year, when the markets panicked about it and our share price dropped.

毕竟，今年早些时候，当市场对此感到恐慌、我们的股价下跌时，他们似乎都不担心。

Man：And fancy Keith Barnes becoming Chief Executive! Did you know he joined as a trainee, thirty years ago?

男：想象一下凯斯·巴恩斯成为首席执行官!你知道他是三十年前作为实习生加入公司的吗?

Woman：Yes, he certainly knows the company, but he's had very little time in positions that'll help him as Chief Executive.

女：是的，他当然了解公司，他在有助于他成为首席执行官的职位上待过很少时间。

I doubt if he'd got what it takes to run a big company like this.

我怀疑他是否具备经营这样一家大公司的条件。

If you ask me, the Chairman wanted to make an internal appointment, and Keith was in the right place at the right time.

如果你问我的话，我觉得董事长想要做一个内部任命，而凯斯在正确的时间出现在正确的地点。

Well we'll see how he turns out, but I reckon he'll only keep the job for as long as the Chairman behind him.

好吧，让我们看看他的表现如何，但我想，只要董事长还在，他就会继续留任。

Man: Yeah, you're probably right. And what about these new plans Keith talked about?

男：是啊，或许你是对的。凯斯谈论的这些新计划是什么？

It seems pretty risky to expand into areas where we've got no experience or expertise.

扩展到我们没有经验或专业知识的领域似乎是很冒险的事情。

This company has been making furniture for years, and we ought to stick to what we're good at, and maybe expand through acquisitions.

这家公司多年来一直在制造家具，我们应该坚持我们擅长的事情，或许通过兼并实现扩张。
