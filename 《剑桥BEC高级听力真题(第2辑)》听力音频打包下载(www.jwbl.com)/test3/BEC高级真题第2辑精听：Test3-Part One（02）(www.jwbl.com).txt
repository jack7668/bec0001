标题：BEC高级真题第2辑精听：Test3-Part One（02）

听力内容：

The third step would be having a meeting with one of our regional consultants. This involves talking through your ideas for development if you get the grant and should help you to focus clearly on your exact needs. And the fourth step is producing a full plan, which needs to include all costs and dates. By this time, both sides will have a very clear picture.

第三步是与我们的一名区域顾问举行会议。会议涉及到如果您得到了资助，您需要详细说明您对发展的想法，这应该有助于您清楚地关注您的确切需求。第四步是制作一个完整的计划，计划需要包括所有的成本和时间。到了这个时候，双方都会有一个非常清晰的想法。

Now, all this obviously takes up quite some time, and you need to think carefully about which personnel within your organisation are going to be available to put in the necessary work. OK, well that's then your role finished for the time being. Meanwhile, we continue to go through your plans in detail. Ultimately, whether or not you get a grant will be decided by our central committee.

所有这些步骤显然要花费很多时间。您需要仔细考虑您的组织中哪些人可以投入必要的工作。好了，那您的角色就暂时结束了。与此同时，我们继续详细地讨论您的计划。最终，我们的中央委员会将会决定您是否能得到我们的资金。

This consists of representatives from our funding bodies and a panel of experts. For logistical reasons, they only meet every three months, so it can take a while for you to hear from us. Now, assuming you are successful - and around eighty percent of applications are - the BSA will be looking to fund seventy percent of your overall requirement.

中央委员会成员由资助机构的代表和专家小组构成。由于组织方面的原因，他们每三个月才见一次面，所以你可能需要一段时间才能收到我们的来信。现在，假设您的申请成功通过了-约有80%的申请会通过-本商业支持机构将为您的总需求提供70%的资金。

That proportion is up from a maximum of sixty percent last year. The payment will be made in quarterly instalments. This has proved to be the most generally useful method all round. The last job for you will be coming up with a progress review, which you need to do at the end of the first year. Right, well, are there any questions?

这一比例高于去年最高的60%。我们将会按季度进行分期付款。这已被证明是最普遍地有用的方法。你的最后一项工作将会是一份进度评估，你需要在第一年末完成。好了，还有什么问题吗？
