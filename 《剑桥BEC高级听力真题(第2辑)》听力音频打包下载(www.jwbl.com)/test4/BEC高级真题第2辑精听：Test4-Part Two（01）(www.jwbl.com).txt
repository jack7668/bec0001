Speaker One

第一位发言人。

Man：It's a shame in many ways because Andrew was doing an excellent job and was a very useful member of the team. The truth is he's probably contributed more than anyone else in terms of sheer energy and ideas to the projects he's worked on. Certainly, he was a lot more popular with the team than his predecessor, in fact he's so good with people from different backgounds and different countries, he used to make me sick sometimes.

男：在很多方面来说，这都很遗憾。因为安德鲁工作很出色，他是团队中非常有用的一员。事实是，就他为参与的项目付出的能量和想法而言，他的贡献可能比其他任何人都要多。当然，他在团队中比他的前任要受欢迎的多。事实上，他和来自不同地区、不同国家的人相处得很好，有时他让我眼红。

But having said that, he was less good at getting on with superiors, I mean you can't keep disagreeing with your line manager over quite basic matters. It's just not on. There was too much conflict. The company had to choose between the two of them. So he's paid the price, but: he won't have any problems getting a new job. Anyway Margaret won't be doing anything urgent, until they decide what to do about a new appointment. She had planned a two-week break starting yesterday but now that's all been put off for two or three months.

话虽如此，他不太擅长和上级相处，我的意思是，你不能总是在一些基本问题上和你的直属上司意见相左。这是绝对不行的。有太多冲突了。公司不得不在两者之间选择一个人。所以他付出了代价，但是：他找新工作完全不成问题。无论如何，玛格丽特不会做任何紧急的事情，直到他们确定如何处理新的任命的问题。她之前计划了从昨天起为期两周的休假，但是那被推迟了两三个月。
