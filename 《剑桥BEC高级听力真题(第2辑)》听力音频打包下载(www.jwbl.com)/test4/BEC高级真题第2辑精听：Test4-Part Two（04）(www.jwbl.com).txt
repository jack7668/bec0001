Speaker Four

第四位发言人。

Woman：Martin has had quite a bit of overseas experience, mainly on sites in South America. Nobody's better at getting on with local managers and resolving conflicts between the various parties working on a project. In the situation we've got out there he'll be just the right man for the job. I've been very impressed with everything he's done since he came to us, I think he's got the perfect mix of expertise and track record, but we've going to miss him at this end.

女：马丁已经有很多海外工作经验，主要是在南美的工作取得的。在和当地经理们相处和解决项目各方之间的冲突方面，没人比马丁做得更好。就目前的情况来看，他就是这个职位的不二人选。自从他加入我们以来，我对他做的任何事情都非常印象深刻，我认为他拥有完美的专业知识和过往履历，但在这方面我们会想念他的。

Fortunately, the woman we've signed up to fill the temporary gap is available for exactly the period that Martin's going to be away. She's been working for an electronics company in France that's just been taken over by a German firm. Actually the boss met her quite by chance the very day she was made redundant. What could be very useful is that she's done quite a lot of budgeting work on development projects.

幸运的是，我们签约填补临时空缺的那位女士正好在马丁离开的这段时间有空。她一直在法国的一家电子公司工作，那家公司刚刚被一家德国公司收购。实际上，老板遇到她完全是个巧合，就在她被解雇的那天。非常有用的是，她做过很多开发项目的预算工作。
