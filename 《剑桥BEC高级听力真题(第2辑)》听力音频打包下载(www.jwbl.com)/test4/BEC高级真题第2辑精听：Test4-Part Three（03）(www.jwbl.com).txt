标题：BEC高级真题第2辑精听：Test4-Part Three（03）

听力内容：

Man: Then I persuaded the food buyer of a major department store to meet me.

男：然后我说服了一家大型百货公司的食品采购员来见我。

When I looked around their food hall I could see they were already selling everything I hoped to supply them with, and my heart sank.

当我环顾他们的食品大厅的时候，我可以看见他们已经在销售所有我希望供应他们的产品，我心头一沉。

But then the buyer said that they felt they were overdependent on their existing supplier and had decided to do something about it. So that's where I came in.

但后来买家说，他们觉得自己对现有供应商过于依赖，决定采取行动。这就是我的切入点。

Woman: It seems your original strategy, of offering everything from toys to jewellery，didn't produce the volume of sales，or profit，you needed.

女：这似乎是你最初的策略，提供从玩具到珠宝的产品，但没有产生你需要的销售额和利润。

Man：I'd imagined that by selling lots of different lines I'd get a good spread of customers, but it didn't really work out like that.

男：我原以为通过销售许多不同的产品系列，我就能把顾客分散开来，但结果并非如此。

Now I'm increasing my turnover by concentrating on just a few lines that I can sell to customers in the same sector.

现在，我只专注于几条可以销售给同一行业客户的生产线，从而提高了我的营业额。

And with food, there are plenty of retailers out there, of all sizes, just waiting for me to come and sell to them, so I've dropped everything else.

在食物方面，有很多各种规模的零售商，等着我把产品卖给他们，所以我放弃了其他一切。

Woman：How do you see the next twelve months?

女：你如何看待接下来的12个月？

Man: I'd like to say I'l1 be hiring someone to handle existing customers,

男：我想说的是，我将雇用一个人来处理现有的客户，

while I concentrate on drumming up new business, and rliat I want to move into export as well as import.

在我集中精力发展新业务的同时，我想同时从事出口和进口业务。

To be realistic, that'll have to wait until I've built up my customer base and turnover quite significantly.

说实在的，那得等到我建立起自己的客户群和相当可观的营业额之后。

Woman: Paul, how do you feel about your first year?

女：保罗，你感觉第一年怎么样？

Man：It's been great. I wish I'd started years ago!

男：非常好。我希望数年前就开始做了！
