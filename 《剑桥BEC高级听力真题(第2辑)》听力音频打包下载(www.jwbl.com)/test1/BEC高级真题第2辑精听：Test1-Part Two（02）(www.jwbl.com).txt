听力内容：

Speaker Two

第二位发言人。

Woman：Well, the whole thing was a serious challenge, and if I'm honest I didn't really feel up to it in the first place. It wasn't a good time to be going away from the office, and I certainly didn't feel happy, being asked to present pretty different ideas at this stage of the game.

女子：整件事情是个很重大的挑战，老实讲，我一开始就觉得自己做不到。这不是离开办公室的好时机，在事情的这个阶段，我被要求执行截然不同的计划，我当然感到不高兴。

I completely understand that the last thing they wanted was to have someone dropping in from above, as it were, and saying, oh，well, we’ve decided to change the rules, etcetera. They'd been applying the system as it was in good faith. And then I was just so tired. What with the wedding celebration going on in the hotel, I definitely didn't get enough rest, and that left me disorientated, so I underperformed.

我完全理解他们最不想看到的是，有人从上面过来说，我们已决定改变规则了，等等。他们一直在充分利用这个系统。然后我就太累了。婚礼是在酒店进行的，我肯定没有得到充足的休息，这让我迷失了方向，所以我表现不佳。
