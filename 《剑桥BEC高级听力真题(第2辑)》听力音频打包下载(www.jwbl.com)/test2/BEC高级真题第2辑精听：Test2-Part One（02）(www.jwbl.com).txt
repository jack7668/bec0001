标题：BEC高级真题第2辑精听：Test2-Part One（02）

听力内容：

And being a small market, geographically speaking, businessmen tend to know each other, so once you do a good job for one customer, then the news travels last round the UAE and you'll soon be getting orders from other agencies or whatever, because they've heard about you. But be warned - it also works the other way! Another point to bear in mind that's true of nearly all markets, but, believe me, it is particularly true of the UAE: don't imagine mailshots or emails are going to produce good results.

作为一个小市场，从地理位置上讲，商人们倾向于互相了解，所以一旦你让一个客户满意，然后消息就会传遍阿联酋，你很快就会收到其他机构的订单，因为他们听说过你。但是请注意-负面消息的传播也是同样的道理！另一点需要牢记的是，几乎所有市场都是如此，但相信我，阿联酋尤其如此。不要指望邮寄广告和电子邮件会带来什么好的效果。

Local businesspeople don't just prefer a personal visit, they insist on it; it's the only approach possible. Now, how to get started: so what are the various ways of selling goods and sendees in the UAE? What I would recommend, to make your first contacts, is attending a trade fair - one of the many held in Dubai. Having made your contacts, there are various options open to you. The most popular way to start is with direct sales to local contractors.

当地商人不仅是更喜欢亲身拜访，他们还坚持这样做；这是唯一可行的方法。现在看看，如何开始：在阿联酋，有什么不同的销售商品和服务的方法呢？我建议，建立第一次联系的方式是参加一次贸易展览会-在迪拜举行的众多博览会之一。建立联系后你就会有很多的选择。最受欢迎的方式是从直接销售给当地承包商开始。

This method is fine for one-off deals or where you just want to try things out. On the other hand, if you're thinking of supplying goods or services to a government body then you've got to have a local agent. Lastly, there's the branch office option or the possibility of going into a joint venture with a local partner. It is always an expensive option, and rhe UAE is no exception in this. In general, I would advise exporters to gain at least five years' experience in the case of the UAE before opening a branch office there, although of course there could be exceptions to this. Now as far as import documentation is concerned...

这种方法适用于一次性交易，或者你只想尝试一下交易。另一方面，如果你想向政府机构提供商品或服务，那么你必须有一个当地的代理商。最后，你可以选择在当地建立分公司，或者和当地的合作伙伴成立合资企业。这总是一个昂贵的选择，阿联酋也不例外。总之，我建议出口商在阿联酋开设分公司前至少要获得5年的经验，当然这种情况也有例外。现在就进口文件而言...
